int main()
{
    // If a value appears in the code and not contained in a variable, they are CONSTANTS (or "literals")
    //  - NOTE: just like variables, there's no guarantee whether a variable is SIGNED or not without specifying explicitly
    // Integer constants are all numberic integers: 1234
    // Long constants will have a suffix of "l" or "L": 1234545345234L
    //
    // Double constants are decimals or exponentials: 1.2, 1.3e-5
    // Float constants has "f" or "F" suffixes
    //
    // Hexadecimals has "0x" or "0X" prefixes
    //
    // Unsigned constants will have "U" suffix
    //  - This can be mixed with all types above
    //
    // Character constants (they will ALWAYS be positive by C's specs): e.g. 'm'
    // - The numerical value of it depends on the character table (mostly ASCII)
