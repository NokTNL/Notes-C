int main()
{
    // If a value appears in the code and not contained in a variable, they are CONSTANTS (or "literals")
    // Integer constants: 1234
    // - Long integers will have a suffix of "l" or "L": 1234545345234L
    // - Integer constants can be represented with octals (`0` prefix) or hexadecimals (`0x` or `0X` prefixes)
    // - Character constants are also integers (they will ALWAYS be positive by C's specs) : e.g. 'm'
    //      - The exact numerical value of it depends on the character table (mostly ASCII)
    //
    // Double constants are decimals or exponentials: 1.2, 1.3e-5
    // Float constants has "f" or "F" suffixes
    //
    // Unsigned constants will have "U" suffix
    //  - This can be mixed with all types above
